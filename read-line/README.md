# Introduction

In this tutorial we learn to read a file line-by-line.
A small routine is implemented to get a list files in a given directory.

Iterate over the files and read each file line-by-line.

- [`readdirSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options) reads files/directories and in a directory
- [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path_options) checks if an object is a file
- [`readline`](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html)
